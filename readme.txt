The code here involves the construction of four machine learning models (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Booster, and LightGBM) as well as the use of the Random Forest model for global distribution prediction of leaf thickness.
The global leaf thickness database I provided contained a total of 33,591 pieces of data, but only 23,692 pieces of data from this database were used for model training. This is because in the extracted remote sensing data, I excluded some anomalous tif data, such as raster data above -30,000m that appeared in the elevation data, raster data with negative soil pH, and data rasters with missing GPP, LAI, and NDVI. Similarly, these outliers were removed from the predictor variables I used for the final prediction in order to ensure the reliability of the predicted data results.
I am using python version 3.12 for windows. It takes about 20 minutes to download the python software, and about 1 1/2 hours to run a complete code. The specific operation of the run: modify the path location where the training data is located, then modify the path location where all the prediction covariate data is located, and run. I have kept all the predictor covariates needed to run the code.
